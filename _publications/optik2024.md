abstract: "Internal photoemission-based hot electron generation at metal-semiconductor junctions holds significant potential for silicon-based sub-bandgap NIR photodetectors. In this work, we designed a simple nickel-silicon Schottky junction using the pulsed laser deposition technique and performed both experimental and theoretical analyses. To reduce the complexity of fabrication and lower costs, we used a planar nickel thin film on top of n-type silicon. The thickness of the nickel thin film was optimized to improve absorption and hot electron generation near the Ni/Si interface. We measured and calculated reflectance using the transfer matrix approach to quantify the effect of thickness on EQE. We also calculated the thickness-dependent absorption profile to estimate hot electron production near the junction. The current-voltage characterization of Ni/n-Si Schottky photodetector was investigated under the dark conditions as well under 1200 nm and 1300 nm light illumination. Under self-bias conditions, a photodiode with a 12 nm Ni thickness exhibits responsivity of 0.124 mA/W and 0.069 mA/W under illumination from 1200 nm and 1300 nm LED light, respectively. Furthermore, we used a comprehensive theoretical model to quantify the planar Ni/Si hot carrier generation and emission efficiency. and experimentally validated the calculated EQEs with the fabricated device. We believe the proposed complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible and simply structured Ni/Si Schottky photodetector will have potential applications in the silicon-based optoelectronics market.

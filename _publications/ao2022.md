abstract: "In this paper, we propose a lithography-free spectrally tunable prefect absorber based on an asymmetric Fabry–Perot cavity using GST, a phase-change material, as the cavity layer. The proposed device shows a maximum absorption of 99.7% at 1550 nm, at a particular angle of incidence and polarization when the phase of GST is in the amorphous state. The absorption spectrum is spectrally switched to longer wavelength when the phase of GST is transformed from amorphous to crystalline. The tuning range is about 866 nm, and the maximum absorption is maintained above 99% in the whole tuning range. The crystallinity ratio of GST is varied by applying voltage pulses of different amplitudes and durations. The electrothermal cosimulations show that the phase change is obtained in the whole GST layer. Furthermore, by reamorphization of GST, the absorption spectrum can be switched back, enabling a reconfigurable perfect absorber. This work shows a viable path toward achieving a tunable perfect absorber covering a 1550 nm communication wavelength window as well as an emerging optical communication window around 2 µm wavelength.

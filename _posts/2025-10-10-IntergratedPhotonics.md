Over the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve been working on designing and modeling several **integrated photonics components** using tools like **GDSFactory**, **KLayout**, and **MEEP**.
The goal is to create a complete library of fundamental photonic building blocks and study their optical performance through simulation.

This post serves as a **summary and navigation page** â€” linking to detailed posts for each component where I discuss the design process, parameters, and simulation results.

## ðŸ§© Passive Components

These are the basic on-chip elements for routing and manipulating light.

- [**Directional Coupler**](/posts/DirectionalCoupler/) â€“ Design and simulation of a compact Si directional coupler.
- [**Y-Branch Splitter**](/posts/ybranch/) â€“ Power splitting using adiabatic Y-junctions.
- [**Ring Resonator**](/posts/ring_resonator/) â€“ Resonant filtering and wavelength-selective behavior.
- [**Bragg Grating**](/posts/Bragg_grating/) â€“ Wavelength reflection and filtering with periodic structures.
- [**Machâ€“Zehnder Interferometer (MZI)**] â€“ Phase-controlled interferometric filter.

## ðŸ’¡ Optical I/O Components

Coupling light between the chip and the outside world.

- [**Grating Coupler**](/posts/grating_coupler/) â€“ Vertical coupling of light using surface gratings.
- [**Edge Coupler**](/posts/edge_coupler/) â€“ Efficient fiber-to-chip coupling at the facet.

## ðŸ§± Modeling and Tools

All designs are implemented and simulated using:
- **GDSFactory** for layout generation and parameterized cell (PCell) design
- **KLayout** for GDS visualization and verification
- **MEEP / MPB** for FDTD and mode simulations
- **Python** for automated parameter sweeps and post-processing

Stay tuned â€” Iâ€™ll be publishing detailed writeups for each of these components, including:
- Layout generation code (`.py` / `.gds`)
- Optical mode and field distribution plots
- Transmission spectra and coupling efficiency
- Optimization steps

## Code for the title circuit image
```python
import gdsfactory as gf
import gdsfactory.schematic as gt
import yaml

n = 2**3
splitter = gf.components.splitter_tree(noutputs=n, spacing=(50, 50))
dbr_array = gf.components.array(
    component=gf.c.dbr, rows=n, columns=1, column_pitch=0, row_pitch=3, centered=True
)
s = gt.Schematic()
s.add_instance("s", gt.Instance(component=splitter))
s.add_instance("dbr", gt.Instance(component=dbr_array))
s.add_placement("s", gt.Placement(x=0, y=0))
s.add_placement("dbr", gt.Placement(x=300, y=0))

for i in range(n):
    s.add_net(
        gt.Net(
            p1=f"s,o2_2_{i+1}",
            p2=f"dbr,o1_{i+1}_1",
            name="splitter_to_dbr",
            settings=dict(radius=5, sort_ports=True, cross_section="strip"),
        )
    )

conf = s.netlist.model_dump(exclude_none=True)
yaml_component = yaml.safe_dump(conf)
circuit = gf.read.from_yaml(yaml_component)
circuit.plot()
```

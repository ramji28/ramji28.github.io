Over the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve been working on designing and modeling several **integrated photonics components** using tools like **GDSFactory**, **KLayout**, and **MEEP**.
The goal is to create a complete library of fundamental photonic building blocks and study their optical performance through simulation.

This post serves as a **summary and navigation page** â€” linking to detailed posts for each component where I discuss the design process, parameters, and simulation results.

## ðŸ§© Passive Components

These are the basic on-chip elements for routing and manipulating light.

- [**Directional Coupler**](/posts/DirectionalCoupler/) â€“ Design and simulation of a compact Si directional coupler.
- [**Y-Branch Splitter**](/posts/ybranch/) â€“ Power splitting using adiabatic Y-junctions.
- [**Ring Resonator**](/posts/ring_resonator/) â€“ Resonant filtering and wavelength-selective behavior.
- [**Bragg Grating**] â€“ Wavelength reflection and filtering with periodic structures.
- [**Machâ€“Zehnder Interferometer (MZI)**] â€“ Phase-controlled interferometric filter.

## ðŸ’¡ Optical I/O Components

Coupling light between the chip and the outside world.

- [**Grating Coupler**] â€“ Vertical coupling of light using surface gratings.
- [**Edge Coupler**] â€“ Efficient fiber-to-chip coupling at the facet.

## ðŸ§± Modeling and Tools

All designs are implemented and simulated using:
- **GDSFactory** for layout generation and parameterized cell (PCell) design
- **KLayout** for GDS visualization and verification
- **MEEP / MPB** for FDTD and mode simulations
- **Python** for automated parameter sweeps and post-processing

Stay tuned â€” Iâ€™ll be publishing detailed writeups for each of these components, including:
- Layout generation code (`.py` / `.gds`)
- Optical mode and field distribution plots
- Transmission spectra and coupling efficiency
- Optimization steps

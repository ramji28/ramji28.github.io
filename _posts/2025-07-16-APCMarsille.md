I presented a contributory talk at the **Advanced Photonics Congress 2025** held in Marseille, France, from July 13â€“17, 2025. My presentation focused on recent work involving **CMOS-compatible metasurface filters** for **simultaneous spectral and angular information retrieval**, enabled by **compressive sensing** techniques.
